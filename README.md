# Cybersecutity & Networking

I am focusing on networking and cybersecurity program at my school. I have a strong interest in technology and enjoy learning how computer systems communicate and how to protect them from cyber threats. At my school, I’m gaining hands-on experience in both the technical and security aspects of networking, which is helping me build a solid foundation for a future career in IT or cybersecurity. I’m passionate about staying updated with the latest developments in the field and always looking for opportunities to grow and expand my skills.
